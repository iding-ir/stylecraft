## Note

This framework is in pre-alpha state. Not remotely completed. I cretaed it for personal use, made it reusable and decided to make it public. I will keep using it in my future projects and will improve it over time.

I decided to use native css features such as CSS Variables and Mask instead of using css preprocessor and font icons for the advantages that I believe they give, but I might also create a LESS version or completely migrate from raw CSS to LESS in the future.

## About Stylecraft

Necessity is the mother of invention. Starting from Nov 16th 2019, the Iranian regime [shut down the internet](https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-iran-amid-fuel-protests-in-multiple-cities-pA25L18b) of the whole country for more than a week.

During that time, other than my regular work, I was developing [Lazy Poker](https://github.com/iding-ir/lazy-poker) and [Mapcraft](https://github.com/iding-ir/mapcraft), and later decided to test Mapcraft with a new project.

Under the influence of [Finn.no](https://kart.finn.no/?tab=iad&ztr=1&searchKey=search_id_realestate_lettings&PROPERTY_TYPE=6&keyword=bergen) I started to develop [Realstate Map](https://github.com/iding-ir/realstate-map).

The problem was that I wanted to make it with a new css framework, but there was no internet connection, so I thought I create a new one.
